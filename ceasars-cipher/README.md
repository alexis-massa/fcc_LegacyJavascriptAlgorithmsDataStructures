# ðŸŽ“ Project : Caesars Cipher

One of the simplest and most widely known ciphers is a Caesar cipher, also known as a shift cipher. In a shift cipher the meanings of the letters are shifted by some set amount.

Write a function which takes a ROT13 encoded string as input and returns a decoded string.

# Tests
- [x] `rot13("SERR PBQR PNZC")` should decode to the string `FREE CODE CAMP`
- [x] `rot13("SERR CVMMN!")` should decode to the string `FREE PIZZA!`
- [x] `rot13("SERR YBIR?")` should decode to the string `FREE LOVE?`
- [x] `rot13("GUR DHVPX OEBJA SBK WHZCF BIRE GUR YNML QBT.")` should decode to the string `THE QUICK BROWN FOX JUMPS OVER THE LAZY DOG.`
